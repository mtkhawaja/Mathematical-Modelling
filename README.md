# MATH 245: Mathematical Modelling

## Introduction

This repository contains the coursework done for [Math 245: Mathematical Modelling](http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/~chanusa/courses/245/19sp/index.html) during the Fall 2019 semester at Queen's College.

## Installing Pre-Requisites

1. [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install Python.
